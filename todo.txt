The Strategy 

Data Science project
github: both of us run it and use it to share files and code
TODO: github client install for Jim -> emailed github support
TODO: natalie figure out how to update fork with master
TODO: jim send natalie URL for new github project
TODO: organize files

J brainstorm things that I would like to learn from the data:
	normalize speed scale 1 - 10 and square distance from the mean
	normalize meters / ,minute and do the same
	add attacking stats: goals, shots, assists, takeons
